##Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis and RFM Analysis on UCI Dataset

Dataset Overview:
This project utilizes a dataset from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository, comprising approximately 5 million records. The dataset was chosen for its comprehensive nature, allowing for in-depth exploratory data analysis and RFM analysis.

Project Objectives:

Data Cleaning: The dataset was thoroughly cleaned to remove duplicates and unavailable records, ensuring data quality and reliability.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to uncover key insights, including identifying the top 5 countries contributing to the dataset.

RFM Analysis: Applied RFM analysis to gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior. RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary, which are critical metrics for evaluating customer value:

Recency: The time elapsed since a customer's last purchase, indicating how recently they have engaged with the business.

Frequency: The number of times a customer has made a purchase within a given period, reflecting their loyalty and engagement level.

Monetary: The total amount spent by a customer, providing insight into their financial contribution to the business.

Tools and Techniques:

Data Cleaning: Utilized Python and pandas for efficient data processing and cleaning.

EDA: Employed various statistical and visualization techniques to explore the dataset.

RFM Analysis: Implemented RFM models to segment customers based on their transactional behavior.

Repository Contents:

Data: The cleaned UCI dataset.

Code: Python scripts for data cleaning, EDA, and RFM analysis.

Documentation: Detailed README file explaining the project methodology, results, and insights gained.

Project Insights:

Top 5 Countries: Identified the top contributing countries to the dataset, providing insights into regional trends.

RFM Segmentation: Segmented customers based on RFM metrics, offering actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies.
